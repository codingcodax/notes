Affirmative sentences in English, which serve to **express** a **reality** or **affirmation**, follow a simple structure composed by `noun + verb + complement`.

Some complement types are:

| example                            |
| ---------------------------------- |
| other [nouns](noun.md) |
| adverbs                            |
| adjectives                         |

And a complement can be either direct or indirect.

Examples of affirmative sentences:

| example             |
| ------------------- |
| It's Monday         |
| My name is Amy      |
| Your name is Amy    |
| she is a girl       |
| She is from Ireland |
