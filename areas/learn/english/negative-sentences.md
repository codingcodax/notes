In grammar, negation is the process that changes an affirmative sentence into a negative sentence.

| affirmative        | negative               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| She is a nice girl | She is not a nice girl |

When there are different elements in a negative sentence, the order to be followed is the following:

1. Subject: it can be a personal pronoun, a proper name or common, etc.
2. Negative auxiliary: it can be a conjugated particle with the verb `to do (don't/doesn't)` or with the verb `to have (haven't/hasn't)`.
3. Verb: varies depending on the verb being referred to.
4. Adverbs of manner: express the way in which the action is being carried out.
5. Place adverbs: express where the action is taking place.
6. Time adverbs: indicate when the action is being taken.

In English, verbs are negated by the word `not` after a verb.

| example                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| I am **not** from Germany                  |
| I do **not** like playing tennis           |
| She does **not** listen to classical music |
| I have **not** read this book yet          |
| I did **not** go to Moscow                 |
| I had **not** had dinner when they came in |
| You should **not** sleep late              |
| I **cannot** help you                      |

Something very important is that there can only a negative word in the sentence. The negative words begin with `n`.

| word    |
| ------- |
| no      |
| not     |
| none    |
| nothing |
| nowhere |
| neither |
| nobody  |
| never   |

|         | correct           | incorrect            |
| ------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| example | I can't get candy | I can't get no candy |

Some negative words are changed to positive words, beginning with the letter `a`, when used with other negative words.

| negative | positive |
| -------- | -------- |
| none     | any      |
| nothing  | anything |
| nobody   | anybody  |
| nowhere  | anywhere |

| correct               | incorrect            |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| I don't have anything | I don't have nothing |
| I have nothing        |                      |

## negation with the verb to be

Unlike the rest of verbs, the verb to be has its own negative form (in the simple form of the present and past) and that is why we shouldn't add any auxiliary in case we are making a denial.

| personal pronoun | verb to be present | verb to be past  |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| I                | am not/'m not      | was not/wasn't   |
| You              | are not/aren't     | were not/weren't |
| He/She/It        | is not/isn't       | was not/wasn't   |
| We               | are not/aren't     | were not/weren't |
| You              | are not/aren't     | were not/weren't |
| They             | are not/aren't     | were not/weren't |

Also, negative forms can be contracted when accompanying certain verbs or pronouns.

| normal     | contracted |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| do not     | don't      |
| does not   | doesn't    |
| am not     | 'm not     |
| are not    | aren't     |
| is not     | isn't      |
| did not    | didn't     |
| have not   | haven't    |
| had not    | hadn't     |
| should not | shouldn't  |
| would not  | would't    |
| will not   | won't      |
