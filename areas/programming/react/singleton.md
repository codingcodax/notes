# Singleton

Share a single global instance throughout the application.

The singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
While it can be useful in managing shared resources or configurations, it can also lead to issues such as global state management, tight coupling, and difficulties in testing.

## Characteristics

- Single instance: Ensures that only one instance of a class exists.
- Global access: Provides a way to access that instance globally.
- Lazy initialization: The instance is created only when it is needed.

## Anti-pattern

The singleton pattern is often referred to as an "anti-pattern" because:

- Global state: It introduces global state into an application, which can lead to hidden dependencies and make testing difficult.
- Tight coupling: It can lead to tightly coupled code, making it harder to manage and maintain.
- Concurrency issues: In multi-threaded applications, managing a singleton can lead to issues if not handled properly.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- Controlled access to a single instance.
- Reduced namespace pollution since it avoids global variables.
- Can be more efficient in terms of resource management.

### Cons

- Difficult to test due to global state.
- Can lead to hidden dependencies.
- May introduce concurrenty issues in multi-threaded environments.
