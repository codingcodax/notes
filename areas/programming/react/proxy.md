# Proxy

Uses and intermediary object to control access to another object.

The proxy pattern is a powerful design pattern that provides a way to control access to an object while maintaining the same interface.
It offers benefits such as enhanced security, separation of concerns, and the ability to add additional functionality.
However, it can also introduce complexity and performance overhead.

## Characteristics

- Interface consistency: The proxy implements the same interface as the real subject, allowing it to be used interchangeably.
- Control: The proxy can control access to the real subject, adding layers of security or validation.
- Lazy initialization: The proxy can delay the creation of the real subject until it is actually needed.
- Additional functionality: Proxies can add functionality such as logging, caching, or monitoring without modifying the real subject.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- Separation of concerns: Enhance modularity by separating the responsibilites of the proxy and the real subject.
- Enhanced security: can restrict acces to the sensitive operations or data.
- Flixitility: Allows for dynamic behaviour changes without altering the real subject.
- Performance optimization: can implement caching strategies to improve performance.

### Cons

- Increased complexity: Adds another layer to the system, which can complicate debugging and maintenance.
- Performance overhead: The additional layer may introduce latency, especially if the proxy performs extensive processing.
- Potential for misuse: If not designed carefully, proxies can lead to unexpected behavior or misuse of the underlying subject.
