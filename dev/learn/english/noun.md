## what is a noun?
The simplest definition of a noun is `a thing`.
This thing can **represent** a person, animal, place, idea, emotion, just about **anything** you can think of.
In English there is **no** grammatical gender to **differentiate** between the **masculine** and the **feminine**.

There are several categories of nouns and a noun may belong to more than one category:
- [countable nouns](#countable)
- [uncountable nouns](#uncountable)
- common nouns
- proper nouns
- specific nouns
- abstract nouns

## uncountable

To consider:
