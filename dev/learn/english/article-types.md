In English, there are not as many variations of the articles as in other languages.
|          | general | specific |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| singular | [a](#a) / [an](#an)  | [the](#the)      |
| plural   |         | [the](#the)      |

Remember that the article is omitted when you refer to something non-specific in the plural form:
| example            |     |
| ------------------ | --- |
| she bought flowers |     |

## a
The article `a` is placed before singular and countable nouns.
| example                     |     |
| --------------------------- | --- |
| he is **a** teacher         |     |
| It is **a** cat             |     |
| She wants to be **a** nurse |     |
| There is **a** dog outside  |     |
| Canada is **a** country.    |     |
| London is **a** city.       |     |

## an
The article `an` and is placed before singular and countable nouns.
It is used when the following noun begins with a vowel or with a silent `h` .
| example                      |     |
| ---------------------------- | --- |
| I am **an** accountant       |     |
| She is **an** american       |     |
| I want to eat **an** avocado |     |

An exception is when the noun begin with `u`, `ew` and `eu` and its projected sound sounds like the word `you`, we must use the article `a`.
| correct                              | incorrect        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Austria is **a** **Eu**ropean country | I need a umbrella |
| Harvard is **a** **university**.                                     |                  |

## the
We use the article `the` to refer to specific objects, with singular or plural nouns.
It's more easy learn exceptions to the rule
