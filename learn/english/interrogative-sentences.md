The interrogative sentences, in English, are used to formulate questions. These follow the following structure: `auxiliary + subject + verb + complement`.

A question in English will take the following order:
1. Interrogative pronoun: denotes the type of question and what is being asked.
2. Interrogative auxiliary: may be a conjugated particle with the verb `to do (do/does)`, with the verb `to have (has/have)` or with the verb `to be (am/is/are)`.
3. Subject: it can be a personal pronoun, proper or common noun, etc.
4. Verb: varies according to the verb tense being referred to.
5. Complement: in the case that there are different elements, the adjective always go first, followed by the noun, in the case that there is a coincidence of this noun.
6. Adverbs of manner: express the way in which the action is being carried out.
7. Place adverbs: express where the action is taking place.
8. Time adverbs: express when the action is being taken.

Not all the questions include all of these components, but the ones that do, should follow this order.

In the following table you will find three examples divided into the different components of a sentence according to the order to be followed.

| interrogative pronoun | axuliary | subject | verb   | rest of sentence |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| Where                 | have     | you     | put    | my jacket?       |
| When                  | do       | we      | meet?  |                  |
| What time             | did      | you     | arrive | at home?         |

## interrogative sentences with the verb to be
The verb `to be`, has its own form in interrogative sentences (in the simple form of the present and past) and that's why we shouldn't add any auxiliary in case we are making a question.

| personal pronoun | verb to be present | verb to be past   |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| I                | Am I...?           | Was I...?         |
| You              | Are you...?        | Were you...?      |
| He/She/It        | Is he/she/it...?   | Was he/she/it...? |
| We               | Are we...?         | Were we...?       |
| You              | Are you...?        | Were you...?      |
| They             | Are they...?       | Were they...?     |

| example                                           |     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Was he the one who sent you a bouquet?            |     |
| Are we in the correct place? I don't know anybody |     |
| Are you already in the bar?                       |     |

## short questions
The short questions, in English, are used to ask for a double opinion or to seek the approval of the interlocutor.
To be able to ask this type of question, we must look at how the sentence is made.
| affirmative sentences    | negative questions |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Have you been in London? | Haven't you?       |

| negative sentences          | affirmative questions |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| You haven't been in London? | Have you?             |

| verb type         | positive example                                 | negative example                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| verb to be        | Is he coming with us isn't he?                   | She isn't at home, is she?            |
| auxiliary do/does | Does she study English doesn't?                  | He doesn't come with us, does he?     |
| auxiliary did     | Did he visit you yesterday, didn't he?           | You didn't go to the dinner, did you? |
| auxiliary have    | Have you already watched this film, haven't you? | They haven't finished yet, have they? |
