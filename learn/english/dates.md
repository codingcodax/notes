In English, the dates are written **month/day/year** format:
| other languages    | english    |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Julio 26 de 1994   | 07/26/1994 |
| Octubre 10 de 2001 | 10/10/2001 |

To indicate that something happens on a certain **month** or **year**, we use the preposition `in`:
| example |     |
| ------- | --- |
| in 1969 |     |
| in May  |     |

To indicate that something happens on a certain **day** or **date**, we use the preposition `on`:
| example     |     |
| ----------- | --- |
| on Monday   |     |
| on July 7th |     |
