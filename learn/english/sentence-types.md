To understand sentence structures, you must first have a general understanding of the types of words that are used to form sentences.

| type      | what it is                                |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [[noun]]  | a person, a place, a thing                |
| verb      | an action                                 |
| adjective | describes a noun                          |
| adverb    | describes other words but not nouns       |
| subject   | the noun or nouns that perform the action |
| object    | the noun or nouns that receive the action |

There are five basic sentence structures in the English language.

| structure              | example                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| subject-verb           | The girl sings         |
| subject-verb-object    | The boy reads the book |
| subject-verb-adjective | Charlie is tall        |
| subject-verb-adverb    | Daniela walks slowly   |
| subject-verb-noun      | He is the actor        |

In English, we can differentiate between 6 main types of sentences.
