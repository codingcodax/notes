Affirmative sentences in English, which serve to express a reality or affirmation, follow a simple structure composed by `noun + verb + complement`.

Some complement types are:
- other nouns
- adverbs
- adjectives

And a complement can be either direct or indirect.

Examples of affirmative sentences:
- It's Monday
- My name is Amy
- Your name is Amy
- She is a girl
- she is from Ireland
